## Overview

I enjoy frontend development, but feel that there's still so much for me to learn. Using Frontend Mentor, I hope to continue to learn and drastically improve my skills. This is my first project with them.

## My process

- Analyze the design photo to come up with the best way to achieve the desired results.
- Write and organize the HTML.
- Write the CSS to have it display as intended.
- Test to make sure that everything adjust as intended if the window is not full screen.


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

It was nice to focus only on HTML and CSS. I realized that there were several declarations that I had forgotten about and a ton that I just haven't used yet. One such declaration that really made this look as intended was 'border-radius'.

One thing I realized doing this project was that I need more practice with mobile-first design. While I know that I've used media queries before in the past, I couldn't remember how to use them here.  I essentially wrote all of my css with fixed dimensions and then went back and re-wrote everything with relative dimensions. 


```css
.card img {
    max-width: auto;
    max-height: 24rem;
    border-radius: 8px; 
}
```
